# Scene editor for ecez

This is a experimental scene editor

It's mostly meant to be a sandbox for [ecez](https://github.com/Avokadoen/ecez) which is my ecs library.

It also features:
 - scene serialization through ecez
 - custom rendering (mostly horribly buggy, feature missing :P )
 - partially implemented GPU-driven
 - custom imgui backend
